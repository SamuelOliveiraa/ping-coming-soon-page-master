![Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Ping coming soon page** as close as possible to the original design.

My biggest difficulties in this project were implementing the Email validation with Js, but after a lot of research and dedication I realized that it wasn't that difficult. I still have a bit of difficulty using JS, but with time I get the hang of it.

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JAVASCRIPT
* Media-queries
* Responsive Website
